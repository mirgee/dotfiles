# dotfiles

Collection of dotfiles to make setup of new machine easier

## Usage

Most of the work can be done just by downloading the repo and either moving it
to `$HOME` dir or even better create symbolic link from `$HOME` dir to files in
this repo. In that case files can be synced just by pulling new versions.

## Setup

``` bash
./setup.sh
```
